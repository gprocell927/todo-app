Challenge: build tedâ.is

tedâ.is was built using create-react-app but there are features that still need to be built. A foundation exists but we need your help to complete it. Please review the tasks below and review this [InvisionApp](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/3ZBHFSYFD#/screens/231128068).

The tasks below are in no particular order. Please approach them as you choose. The goal is to better understand your technical understanding, not to finish every task below so please limit yourself to 5 hours or less on this challenge. Once you are finished, please post your work in a new Github repository and share the link or invite me as a collaborator (tim@headway.io).

And please don't hesitate to reach me anytime at tim@headway.io.
